# JudoTest
This a technical test prior to an interview.

This was implemented using Outside-In style TDD.
The test cases are not exhaustive (due to time constraints). There will likely be edge cases that fail (eg UTF8 characters, some special characters).

The git checkins are relatively granular, so TDD flow should be somewhat visible.
